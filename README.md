# pronounce.it

## Inspiration
Learning a new language through self study is hard with traditional methods. Many methods are not interactive or do not give proper feedback. Our app specifically addressing how can users better improve their speech and pronunciation in foreign languages. A user will be able to speak to our interactive mobile app, and get their results instantly. Our app will help the speaker practice by re-seeing and pronouncing missed words, and openly hearing what they pronounced right and wrong for future improvement. 

## What it does
Introducing **pronounce.it**, a user-friendly app for language learners that focuses on pronunciation, something that tends to be overlooked by some language learners. Depending on the accuracy of the pronunciation, the app will reinforce previously missed words to make sure that the learner pronounces the words well.

## Features
- Speech recognition-based learning that compares your speech to correct pronunciation
- Progressive lesson plan so app is beginner friendly.
- Revisit missed words later on in session.
